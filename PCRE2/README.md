# PCRE2 - Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions - For Visual Studio 2022

This is just my personal extraction of the original PCRE2 library, so I won't need to reconfig it 
every it changes to suit my projects. But if you have any difficulties setting up
usage of this library for yourself, feel free to copy one of the projects, because
I've done all the config necessary to compile this on Visual Studio 2022.

For information of what this library does, check the original [README.md](README-ORIGINAL.md) file.

Cheers.
